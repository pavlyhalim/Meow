# Assignment 3: Sound

## Project Description:

Our project shows a conversation between four cats which makes up a story together. When you open the site, you see the instructions about how to interact with the cats to enable their dialogues sequentially. And when you close that instruction pop-up window, you start on clicking the cats to start the conversation between them from the top left and then continue clicking and different cats pop ups and delivers a dialogue.
The story unfolds like this: One cat is complaining about humans, and the others give it some reasoning on why the cat should be grateful to the humans instead. And at the last, the cat realized his mistake and understood human's unconditional love for cats :) So basically it's a short and simple story about the cats and humans through conveying dialogues from the cats.

## Process:

Our group splitted all the work among themselves. Here's how:

Raya wrote the script for the dialogues deliverable by the main characters of our website which are the cats, and Vir and Raya recorded the dialogues in different voices. Marwan and Pavly worked on coding the website using HTML, CSS, and JS and embedded the audio recordings on the cats. Everyone did the planning together to make the user experience better and easier.

## Reflection:

Our final outcome quiet resembled to what we had initially planned. Putting the sound on sequentially on the cats was the hardest part to do, but that was the most important part for the user interactive interface. All the sounds that we used were originally recorded by us using the equipment center's instruments. Overall, the flow of the story is the hero of our project I guess :)
