# Assignment 3: Sound

## Project Description:

Our project shows a conversation between four cats which makes up a story together. When you open the site, you see the instructions about how to interact with the cats to enable their dialogues sequentially. And when you close that instruction pop-up window, you start on clicking the cats to start the conversation between them from left to right. 
The story unfolds like this: One cat is complaining about humans, and the others give it some reasoning on why the cat should be grateful to the humans instead. And at the last, the cat realized his mistake and understood human's unconditional love for cats :) So basically it's a short and simple story about the cats and humans through conveying dialogues from the cats.

## Task Division:

Our group splitted all the work among themselves. Here's how:

1. Raya: Writing the script for cats' dialogues, recording audio, documentation
2. Marwan: Idea implementation, coding for the website
3. Vir: Recording audio
4. Pavly: Idea implementation, coding for the website

## Reflection:

Our final outcome quiet resembled to what we had initially planned. Putting the sound on sequentially on the cats was the hardest part to do, but that was the most important part for the user interactive interface. All the sounds that we used were originally recorded by us using the equipment center's instruments. Overall, the flow of the story is the hero of our project I guess :)
