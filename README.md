# Assignment 3: Sound

## Project Description:

Our project shows a conversation between four cats which makes up a story together. When you open the site, you see the instructions about how to interact with the cats to enable their dialogues sequentially. And when you close that instruction pop-up window, you start on clicking the cats to start the conversation between them from left to right. 
The story unfolds like this: One cat is complaining about humans, and the others give it some reasoning on why the cat should be grateful to the humans instead. And at the last, the cat realized his mistake and understood human's unconditional love for cats :) So basically it's a short and simple story about the cats and humans through conveying dialogues from the cats.

## Task Division:

Our group splitted all the work among themselves. Here's how:

1. Raya wrote the script for the cat's dialogues and recorded sound for it
2. Marwan 
3. Vir
4. Pavly

## Reflection:

Our final outcome
